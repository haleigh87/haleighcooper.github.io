<p> The night was set for success with not one but THREE women hosting the oscars, 
two of which were women of color. Sunday night was set to be a big event for women 
of color, especially with the the first openly queer Afro-Latina, <b> Ariana DeBose</b>,
winning an acting Oscar, or more specifically Best Supporting Actress. 
Various other important moments happened, from only the second deaf award 
winning actor, <b>Troy Kotsur</b>,winning best supporting actor, to Best Actress 
<b> Jessica Chastain</b> speaking on issues such as suicide and anti-LGBTQ legislation.</p>

<p> But alas, the only thing anyone can seem to talk about is <b>Will Smith</b>. 
    Not about the first Oscar he has ever won, nor that it is Best Actor, but 
    the fact that he slapped <b>Chris Rock</b> on stage after he made an 
    inappropriate joke about Will Smith's wife and actress <b> Jada Pickett-Smith</b> 
    <br>
    For more information about the slap and the rest of the event, please follow the links below. </p>
